# MAIHDA_opencode

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MAIHDA_opencode is to host the elements of analytical code that 
underpin the publication 'Intersectional inequalities in late diagnosis of 
colorectal cancer in England, 2013 to 2019', submitted to JECH in late 2024

This code has been adapted slightly from the working repository of that
project to protect organisational information or individual analysts' identities.

This repo is authored and created by Dr CE Welsh (claire.welsh8@nhs.net).
